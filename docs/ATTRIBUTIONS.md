## Core Implementation
- Motor control logic derived from [Elegoo's official protocol](Communication%20protocol%20for%20Smart%20Robot%20Car.pdf).  
- Network code structure based on course materials [ELEEGOCar-SocketLibrary.pdf].

## Third-Party Code
- Camera integration inspired by [ESP32-S3-EYE Guide]
  - course provided material for implementation and useof the SmartCar camera.
- Network code adapted from course provided materials [ELEEGOCar-SocketLibrary]. 
  
## Tools & Libraries
- TensorFlow Lite Micro for model deployment.
- DeepSeek for debugging assistance (custom layer fixes).
